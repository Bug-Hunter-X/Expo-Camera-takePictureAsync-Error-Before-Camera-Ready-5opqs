This error occurs when using Expo's `Camera` API and attempting to access the `takePictureAsync` method before the camera has fully initialized.  This often happens when the component renders before the camera has finished setting up.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage:
<Camera type={CameraType.back} style={cameraStyle} onCameraReady={this.onCameraReady}>
  <Button title="Take Picture" onPress={this.takePicture} />
</Camera>

// takePicture method
takePicture = async () => {
  if (this.camera) {
    try {
      let photo = await this.camera.takePictureAsync();
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Error taking picture', err);
    }
  }
}
```
